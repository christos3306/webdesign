			<summary>More About Me</summary>
			<p>I was born in South Jersey. I am a only child, when i was two years old we moved from the United States to Greece were my father is from. A few years later we moved back to the state, i guess my father relized why he left in the first place. But it was nice to see family i have never met before. I would not go back to Greece till i was sixteen years old. For my grandfather funeral.</p>
			<p>I had a very normal childhood. Both my parents worked as many hours as they could to provide for me and put a roof over my head. When i was thirteen my father bought his first diner. From there over the next ten years he taught me the business and how to be a chef. By tweenty two i bought my first restuarant. In 2010 a fire burned it to the ground. Took alot to come back from that.</p>
			<p>In 2016 my father past, found myself over the years wanting a better life for my wife and kids. So here i am going back to school to do something i like, rather than working seventy hours a week. Doing something i just have no intrest in doing anymore.</p>
